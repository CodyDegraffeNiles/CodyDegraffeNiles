My favorite part of coding is, surprisingly, debbugging. I crave the sense of accomplishment as well as wonder that comes with squashing a particularly hard bug and see code working as intended. I especially enjoy collobarting with others to fully understand and breakdown what is causing the bug and how to fix it.

Feel free to contact me at codypdniles@gmail.com.
