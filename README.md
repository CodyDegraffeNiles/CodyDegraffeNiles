As a software enginner, my favorite part of the job is, surprsingly, debbugging. I enjoy the sense of accomplishment as well as wonder that comes with squashing a particular hard bug and see my code working as intended. I, especially, enjoy collobarting with others to full breakdown and fix our code.

Feel free to contact me at codypdniles@gmail.com.

Check out my projects below, which I think are pretty cool.
